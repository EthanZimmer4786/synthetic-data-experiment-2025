# synthetic-data-experiment
This repository is a collection of the code written by myself for my 2024-2025 research project on the usage of synthetic data in object detection.
The code here should only be used as a reference, because there are likely numerous bugs or errors as I was still learning python at the time.

## CIFAKE Dataset
The CIFAKE dataset contains real photographs from CIFAR-10 and synthetic images created with Stable Diffusion version 1.4.

**The dataset is available here:**

**And the paper written by Jordan J. Bird involving this dataset is available here:**
